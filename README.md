# The game: Catch, run & fun
This project is a serious videogame that has to catch the attention of the users in order to change their lifestyle. Gamification and its technique of challenging and rewarding the users for the result gained, has been the way used to let this happen.
In the repository is included a PDF documentation, where all the efforts and the informations about the work done are reported.
